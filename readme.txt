== Description ==

<p>Simple counter-plugin with no external libs based on Counterize II by Steffen Forkmann
(<a href="http://www.navision-blog.de/counterize">http://www.navision-blog.de/counterize</a>)</p>
<p>Saves timestamp, visited URl, referring URl and browserinformation in database,
and can display total hits, unique hits and other statistics in WordPress webpages.</p>
<p>Admin-interface available with detailed information.</p>
<p><b>Counterize II doesn't store any IP information since the 2.13 version, because this is illegal in some countries (e.g. Germany).
Counterize stores only a small hash to distinguish between different users and to get information about the user count.</b></p>
